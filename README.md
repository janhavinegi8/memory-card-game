# MEMORY CARD GAME by Janhavi Negi
## Description
- This is a command-line Memory Card Game where the player matches pairs of hidden symbols. The game starts with a grid of 16 hidden cards, and the player must uncover matching pairs of symbols to win. The game keeps track of the player’s score, which increases by 1 for every matching pair. The goal is to match all pairs to complete the game.
